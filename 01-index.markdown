The workshop "Next steps in IoT-Edge-Cloud Continuum Evolution: Research and Practice", co-hosted with Euro-PAR 2024, sets the goal of presenting the visionary papers and talks from research and practice in the
evolution of the computing continuum encompassing IoT, edge and cloud. From the challenges of system
performance, management and ambitious vision towards a single MetaOS in the continuum, there is a
broad set of topics to be addressed. This call invites for the technical presentations and interactive
workshop sessions, including industrial leaders, researchers, developers and academics fostering the
exchange of research findings and ideas as well as enabling research cooperation as well as industrial
leadership. This workshop plans to push the boundaries of what is currently possible with existing Cloud-
Edge-IoT orchestration solutions, paving the way for the future “MetaOS” in a compute continuum. We
invite for the submission of papers on one of the topics below.

# Topics of interest

* Application orchestration in the continuum
* Enablers and tools for the continuum, services or applications
* Novel design paradigms for distributed services and applications
* Network management in the continuum
* MetaOS approaches towards a functional continuum
* Inter-cluster communication and coordination for the continuum
* Performance analysis and measurements in the continuum
* Predictive maintenance, resource allocation or optimization through AI/ML
* Energy and resource efficiency/optimization in the continuum
* Migration, offloading and inter-device collaboration for cloud, edge and IoT
* Function-as-a-Service and serverless in the cloud-edge-IoT continuum
* Multi-tenancy in the continuum
* Security and privacy for the continuum
* Configuration and connectivity troubleshooting in a continuum
* Continuum testbeds and practical use cases
* Open-source standards
* Developer’s experiences and lessons learned

With the audience of Euro-Par consisting mainly of researchers and developers from the areas of parallel
and distributed processing, systems and infrastructures, this workshop will broaden the platform to
exchange views, ideas and solutions regarding a new management paradigm for distributed systems,
architectures and applications.

# Important Dates

* Paper submission deadline: May 6th, 2024  - AoE
